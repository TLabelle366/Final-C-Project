# Final-C-Project
Done by Alexandr Pokorskiy and Tyler Labelle

We built a launcher for our unity project, so 
please open the windows form folder labelled 
"Tetris". If you run the launcher, and click 
the button, the game will run.

If you want to see the code for the unity project,

The files were too much to upload to github....
